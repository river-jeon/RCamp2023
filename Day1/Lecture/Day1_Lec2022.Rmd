# 1. Why should we learn R?

* R is the language of data science both in academia and industry. (most
  commonly used)
* R is free and open-source.
* R is optimized for vector operations. (It means that you can easily go through
  an entire row or an entire table of data without having to write explicitly
  for loops.)
* R has over 10,000+ contributing packages. This makes it possible to do almost
  everything you need.
  (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html)
* R has a great community of programmers. (If you ever encounter an error or
  warning in your program, you will likely find solutions online just by copying
  and pasting your error messages into Google search bar.)

# 3. The Basics 
This section provides a broad overview of the R language that will get you
programming right away. Don't worry if you have never programmed before. This
section will teach you everything you need to know to get started. 

## 3.1 The R User Interface

R is a programming language that you can use to communicate with your computer,
and RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed for R. 

The RStudio interface is simple. You type R code into the bottom line of the
RStudio console pane and then hit Enter to run it. The code you type is called
a command, because it will command your computer to do something for you. The
line you type it into is called the command line.

When you type a command at the prompt and hit Enter, your computer executes the
command and shows you the results. Then RStudio displays a fresh prompt for your
next command. For example, if you type 1 + 1 and hit Enter, RStudio will display:

```{r}
1 + 1
```


### 3.1.1 Bracketed Numbers in Console Output

You might notice that a [1] appears next to your results. R is just letting you
know that this line begins with the first value in your results. Some commands
return more than one value, and their results may fill up multiple lines. For
example, the command 100:130 returns 31 values; it creates a sequence of
integers from 100 to 130. Notice that new bracketed numbers appear at the
start of the first and second lines of output. These numbers just mean that the
first line begins with the 1st value in the result, and the second line begins
with the 20th value. 

You can mostly ignore the numbers that appear in brackets:

```{r}
# The colon operator (:) returns every integer between two integers.
# It is an easy way to create a sequence of numbers.
100:130
```


### 3.1.2 Incomplete or Wrong Commands 

If you type an incomplete command and press Enter, R will display a + prompt,
which means R is waiting for you to type the rest of your command. Either finish
the command or hit Escape to start over:

```{r eval=F}
> 5 -
+
+ 1
[1] 4
```

If you type a command that R doesn’t recognize, R will return an error message.
If you ever see an error message, don’t panic. R is just telling you that your
computer couldn’t understand or do what you asked it to do. You can then try a
different command at the next prompt:

```{r eval = F}
> 3 % 5
Error: unexpected input in "3 % 5"
>
# Here the user is trying to do modulus in R, but fails to use the correct
# operator for modulus %%.
```

Once you get the hang of the command line, you can easily do anything in R that
you would do with a calculator. For example, you could do some basic arithmetic:

```{r}
2 * 3
4 - 1
6 / (4 - 1)

2 ^ 3
2 ** 3
'^'(2,3)

3 + 3 * 20
(3+3) *20
```

R follows the order of operations, where precedence follows the BEDMAS order:
Brackets(), Exponents ^, Division / and Multiplication *, Addition + and
Subtraction -. 

## 3.2 Comments in R 

1. Comments are like helping text in your R program and they are ignored by the 
  interpreter while executing your actual program, i.e. comments will not be run
  or executed. 
2. A single comment is written using # in the beginning of the statement:
```{r}
# This is a comment.
## This is also a comment.
### This is still a comment.
### Comment again. #######

# line 1
# line 2
```
3. Multiple Comments: Block + 
  - On Windows and Linux, Ctrl + Shift + C.
  - On macOS, Cmd + Shift + C.


## \textcolor{red}{In-class exercises 1.2:}

That’s the basic interface for executing R code in RStudio. Think you have it?
If so, try doing these simple tasks. If you execute everything correctly, you 
should end up with the same number that you started with:

1. Choose any number and add 2 to it.
2. Multiply the result by 3.
3. Subtract 6 from the answer.
4. Divide what you get by 3.
```{r}
37 + 2
39 * 3
117 - 6
111 /3

```



## 3.3 Example: A Virtual Die
Now that you know how to use R, let’s use it to make a virtual die together.
The : operator gives you a nice way to create a group of numbers from one to
six. The : operator returns its results as a vector, a one-dimensional set of
numbers:

```{r}
1:6
```

Running 1:6 generated a vector of numbers for you to see, but it did not save
that vector anywhere in your computer's memory. What you are looking at is
basically the footprints of six numbers that existed briefly and then melted
back into your computer’s RAM. If you want to use those numbers again, you’ll
have to ask your computer to save them somewhere. You can do that by creating
an R object.

R lets you save data by storing it inside an R object. What is an object? Just a
name that you can use to call up stored data. For example, you can save data
into an object like a or b. Wherever R encounters the object, it will replace it
with the data saved inside, like so:

```{r}
a <- 1 # assignment statement <- or =
a
a + 2
a
b = a + 2
a
```

To create an R object, choose a name and then use the less-than symbol, <,
followed by a minus sign, -, to save data into it. This combination looks
like an arrow, **<-**. R will make an object, give it your name, and store in it
whatever follows the arrow. So a <- 1 stores 1 in an object named a. You can
also use = instead of <- to assign values to variables. For example, a = 1 and
a <- 1 are equivalent here. When you ask R what’s in a, R tells you on the next
line.You can use your object in new R commands, too. Since a previously stored
the value of 1, you’re now adding 1 to 2.

When you create an object, the object will appear in the environment pane (upper
right) of RStudio. You can name an object in R almost anything you want, but
there are a few rules:

1. A name cannot start with a number.
2. A name cannot use some special symbols, like ^, !, $, @, +, -, /, or *. 
3. Good names should be concise and informative. 

R is **case-sensitive**, so var and Var will refer to different objects:
```{r}
var <- 0
Var <- 1
var + 1
Var + 1
vAR = 10
vaR = 100
```


Finally, R will overwrite any previous information stored in an object without
asking you for permission. So, it is a good idea to not use names that are
already taken. The same goes for functions.
```{r}
my_number0 <- 1
my_number0
my_number1 <- 999
my_number1
```

You can see which object names you have already used with the function ls().
```{r}
ls()
```
You can also see which names you have used by examining RStudio’s environment
pane.

Let's create a vector called die that contains the numbers one through six. 
```{r}
die <- 1:6
die = 1:6
die
# R is case-sensitive, so die and DIE are two different vectors
DIE <- 5:8
DIE
Die <- 10:15
Die
die - 1
die / 2
die * die
```

You may notice that R does not always follow the rules of matrix multiplication.
Instead, R uses element-wise execution. When you manipulate a set of numbers, R
will apply the same operation to each element in the set. So for example, when
you run die - 1, R subtracts one from each element of die.

```{r}
die
die - 1
```


When you use two or more vectors in an operation, R will line up the vectors and
perform a sequence of individual operations. For example, when you run die *
die, R lines up the two die vectors and then multiplies the first element of
vector 1 by the first element of vector 2. R then multiplies the second element
of vector 1 by the second element of vector 2, and so on, until every element
has been multiplied. The result will be a new vector the same length as the
first two.

```{r}
die = 1:6
die - 1
die * (die-1)
```


If you give R two vectors of unequal lengths, R will repeat the shorter vector
until it is as long as the longer vector, and then do the math. This isn’t a
permanent change, and the shorter vector will be its original size after R does
the math. If the length of the short vector does not divide evenly into the
length of the long vector, R will return a warning message. This behavior is
known as vector recycling, and it helps R do element-wise operations:

```{r}
1:2

1:4

die

die + 1:2


die + 1:4
```


**Element-wise operations ** are a very useful feature in R because they
manipulate groups of values in an orderly way. When you start working with data
sets, element-wise operations will ensure that values from one observation are
only paired with values from the same observation. Element-wise operations also
make it easier to write your own programs and functions in R.

But don’t think that R has given up on traditional matrix multiplication. You
just have to ask for it when you want it. For example, you can do inner
multiplication with the %*% operator:

```{r}
die %*% die
```

You can also do things like transpose a matrix with t() and take its determinant
with det(). Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with these operations. They are
easy to look up. R offers a help() function that you can use when you encounter
unfamiliar operators, functions, pacakges, etc. You can also use the shortcut
"?" symbol to do the same.

```{r}
help("%*%")
?mean
help("+")

```

## \textcolor{red}{In-class exercises 1.3:}

1. Create a new object named "numbers" that contains the numbers from one
   through one hundred.
2. Show the values in the object "numbers". 
3. Add two to each element in numbers, and store the new sequence into another
   object named "numbers2".
4. Show the values in the object "numbers2". 
5. Add one the odd elements in numbers (e.g. 1,3,5,7,9...), and add two to the
   even elements in numbers. Store the new sequence in a new object named
   "numbers3".
6. Show the values in the object "numbers3".



# 4. R Objects

In this section, we will learn about different R objects by using it to assemble
a deck of 52 playing cards.

We will start by building simple R objects that represent playing cards and then
work our way up to a full-blown table of data. In short, we will build the
equivalent of an Excel spreadsheet from scratch. When we are finished, our deck
of cards will look something like this:

```{r eval=F}
 face   suit value
 king spades    13
queen spades    12
 jack spades    11
  ten spades    10
 nine spades     9
eight spades     8
...
```

Do you need to build a data set from scratch to use it in R? Not at all. In Day
2's lecture content we will cover loading data sets into R with on simple step.

This exercise will teach you how R stores data, and how you can assemble or
disassemble your own data sets. You will also learn about the various types of
objects available for you to use in R (not all R objects are the same!).

We will start with the very basics. The most simple type of object in R is an
atomic vector. Atomic vectors are not nuclear powered, but they are very simple
and they do show up everywhere. If you look closely enough, you will see that
most structures in R are built from atomic vectors.

## 4.1 Atomic Vectors 

An atomic vector is just a simple vector of data. In fact, you have already
encountered an atomic vector from making the die that contains numbers one
through six. You can make an atomic vector by grouping some values of data
together with c():
```{r}
die <- 1:6 # "integer"
die <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) # "double"
die

# is.vector tests whether an object is an atomic vector.
# It returns TRUE if the object is an atomic vector and FALSE otherwise.
is.vector(die)
```

You can also make an atomic vector with just one value. R saves single values as
an atomic vector of length 1:
```{r}
five <- 5
five
is.vector(five)
# length returns the length of an atomic vector.
length(five) # 1
length(die)
```

Each atomic vector stores its values as a one-dimensional vector, and each
atomic vector can only store one type of data. You can save different types of
data in R by using different types of atomic vectors. Altogether, R recognizes
six basic types of atomic vectors: doubles, integers, characters, logicals,
complex, and raw.

To create your card deck, you will need to use different types of atomic vectors
to save different types of information (text and numbers). You can do this by
using some simple conventions when you enter your data. For example, you can
create a character vector by surrounding your input in quotation marks:

```{r}
num <- 13 # double by default.
text <- "ace"
```

Each type of atomic vector has its own convention (described below). R will
recognize the convention and use it to create an atomic vector of the
appropriate type. If you’d like to make atomic vectors that have more than one
element in them, you can combine an element with the c() function from Packages
and Help Pages. Use the same convention with each element:
```{r}
text <- c("ace", "hearts")
num <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,10)
```

You may wonder why R uses multiple types of vectors. Vector types help R behave
as you would expect. For example, R will do math with atomic vectors that
contain numbers, but not with atomic vectors that contain character strings:
```{r}
sum(die)
die
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
sum(text)
sum("ace")
# Error in sum(text) : invalid 'type' (character) of argument
charToRaw("10")
```

### 4.1.1 Doubles
A double vector stores regular numbers. The numbers can be positive or negative,
large or small, and have digits to the right of the decimal place or not. In
general, R will save any number that you type in R as a double by default.
```{r}
.5
0.5
die <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
# typeof() tells us what type of object an object is
typeof(die)
# NOT the same as die <- 1:6
```

Some R functions refer to doubles as “numerics”. Double is a computer science
term. It refers to the specific number of bytes your computer uses to store a
number. "Numeric" is a much more intuitive term to use when doing data analysis.

### 4.1.2 Characters 
A character vector stores small pieces of text. You can create a character
vector in R by typing a character or string of characters surrounded by quotes:
```{r}
text <- c("Joe",  "Biden")
text
typeof(text)
typeof("Biden")
# The maximum value (also used as default) that can be set is 65535. Strings
# longer than that will be truncated. Which means you will rarely run out of
# space to store character strings.
```

The individual elements of a character vector are known as strings. Note that a
string can contain more than just letters. You can assemble a character string
from numbers or symbols as well.
```{r}
text <- c("123456", "Hi!", "/ This is the division symbol.")
text
typeof(text)
```


### 4.1.3 Logicals 

Logical vectors store TRUEs and FALSEs, R’s form of Boolean data. Logicals are
very helpful for doing things like comparisons:
```{r}
3 > 4
sqrt(2)^2 - 2  == 0
# Be careful of floating-point error due to R's limitation on storing doubles.
```

Any time you type TRUE or FALSE in capital letters (without quotation marks), R
will treat your input as logical data. R also assumes that T and F are shorthand
for TRUE and FALSE, unless they are defined elsewhere (e.g. T <- 500). Since the
meaning of T and F can change, its best to stick with TRUE and FALSE. It is also
good practice to not name your variables T or F if possible.
```{r}
F = FALSE
logic <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
logic
typeof(logic)
typeof(FALSE)
typeof(TRUE)
```


## 4.2 Attributes 

An attribute is a piece of information that you can attach to an atomic vector
or any R object. The attribute won’t affect any of the values in the object, and
it will not appear when you display your object. You can think of an attribute
as “metadata”; it is just a convenient place to put information associated with
an object. R will normally ignore this metadata, but some R functions will check
for specific attributes. These functions may use the attributes to do special
things with the data.

You can see which attributes an object has with attributes. attributes() will
return NULL if an object has no attributes. An atomic vector, like die, won’t
have any attributes unless you give it some:
```{r}
a <- 1
a
die <- 1:6
attributes(die)
# R uses NULL to represent the null set, an empty object.
# NULL is often returned by functions whose values are undefined.
# You can create a NULL object by typing NULL in capital letters.
```

### 4.2.1 Names 
The most common attributes to give an atomic vector are names, dimensions (dim),
and classes. Each of these attributes has its own helper function that you can
use to give attributes to an object. You can also use the helper functions to
look up the value of these attributes for objects that already have them. For
example, you can look up the value of the names attribute of die with names:
```{r}
names(die)
```
NULL means that die does not have a names attribute. 

You can given a "names" attribute to die like this: 
```{r}
# The vector should include one name for each element in die
names(die) <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six")

# Now die has a names attribute
attributes(die)
die
```

To remove the names attribute, set it to NULL:
```{r}
names(die) <- NULL
names(die)
die
```


### 4.2.2 Dimension 

Atomic vectors are 1-dimensional. You can get the length of them via the
function length().
```{r}
length(die)

```

You can transform an atomic vector into an n-dimensional array by giving it a
dimensions attribute with dim.

To do this, set the dim attribute to a numeric vector of length n. R will
reorganize the elements of the vector into n dimensions. Each dimension will
have as many rows or columns as the nth value of the dim vector. For example,
you can reorganize die into a 2 × 3 matrix (which has 2 rows and 3 columns):
```{r}
dim(die) <-c(2, 3)
die
```

R will always use the first value in dim for the number of rows and the second
value for the number of columns. In general, rows always come first in R
operations that deal with both rows and columns.

You don’t have much control over how R reorganizes the values into rows and
columns. For example, R always fills up each matrix by columns, instead of by
rows. In the next section, we will talk about how to customize the process.


## 4.3 Matrices 
Matrices store values in a two-dimensional array, just like a matrix from linear
algebra that we learned in Math Modeling. To create one, first give matrix an
atomic vector to reorganize into a matrix. Then, define how many rows should be
in the matrix by setting the nrow argument to a number. matrix will organize
your vector of values into a matrix with the specified number of rows.
Alternatively, you can set the ncol argument, which tells R how many columns to
include in the matrix:
```{r}
die = 1:6
die
m <- matrix(die, nrow = 2, byrow = FALSE)
m
```

matrix will fill up the matrix column by column by default, but you can fill the
matrix row by row if you include the argument byrow = TRUE:
```{r}
m <- matrix(die, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
m
```

You can also create a matrix by providing the numbers directly like this: 
```{r}
matrix(1,3,2) # This creates a 3 by 2 unit matrix
# (value, row, col)
matrix(0,4,3) # This creates a 4 by 3 zero matrix
```

### 4.3.1 Checking the Dimension 
```{r}
A <- matrix(c(2,3,-2,1,2,2),3,2)
A
dim(A)
```

### 4.3.2 Multiplication by a Scalar
```{r}
3 * A
```


### 4.3.3 Matrix Addition & Subtraction
```{r}
B <- matrix(c(1,4,-2,1,2,1),3,2)
A
B
A + B
A - B
```
### 4.3.4 Matrix Multiplication
```{r}
C <- matrix(c(2,-2,1,2,3,1),2,3)
A
C
dim(C)
dim(A)
C %*% A
A %*% C
```


### 4.3.5 Transpose of a Matrix
```{r}
A
t(A)
t(t(A))
```

### 4.3.6 Inverse of a Matrix
```{r}
D <- matrix(c(4,4,-2,2,6,2,2,8,4),3,3)
D
solve(D)
```


### 4.3.7 Determinant of a Matrix
```{r}
D
det(D)
```

### 4.3.8 Horizontal Concatenation
```{r}
A
B
cbind(A,B)
```


### 4.3.9 Vertical Concatenation (Appending)
```{r}
rbind(A,B)
```


## \textcolor{red}{In-class exercises 1.4:}


1. Create a 3 by 3 identity matrix I.
2. Create another 3 by 3 matrix M with numbers 1 through 9, i.e. the first row
   should be 1, 2, 3, etc.
3. Print the diagonal of M. 
4. Multiply M by 10, and save the new matrix as N. 
5. Find the determinant of M. 
6. Transpose M. 
7. Does M have an inverse? If so, find the inverse of M. If not, explain why.



## 4.4 Lists

Lists are like atomic vectors because they group data into a one-dimensional
set. However, lists do not group together individual values; lists group
together R objects, such as atomic vectors and other lists. For example, you can
make a list that contains a numeric vector of length 31 in its first element, a
character vector of length 1 in its second element, and a new list of length 2
in its third element.

To do this, use the list function. list() creates a list the same way c()
creates a vector. Separate each element in the list with a comma:
```{r}
list1 <- list(100:130, "R", list(TRUE, FALSE))
list1
```

The double-bracketed indices tell you which element of the list is being
displayed. The single-bracket indices tell you which sub-element of an element
is being displayed.

For example, [[1]] [1] 100 is the first subelement of the first element in the
list. [[2]] [1] "R" is the first sub-element of the second element in the list.
This two-system notation arises because each element of a list can be any R
object, including a new vector (or list) with its own indices.

Lists are a basic type of object in R, on par with atomic vectors. Like atomic
vectors, they are used as building blocks to create many more sophisticated
types of R objects.

As you can imagine, the structure of lists can become quite complicated, but
this flexibility makes lists a useful all-purpose storage tool in R: you can
group together anything with a list.

However, not every list needs to be complicated. You can store a playing card in
a very simple list.


## \textcolor{red}{In-class exercises 1.5:}

1. Use a list to store a single playing card, like the ace of hearts, which has
   a point value of one. The list should save the face of the card, the suit,
   and the point value in separate elements.

```{r}
card <- list("ace", "hearts", 1)
card
```

You can also use a list to store a whole deck of playing cards. Since you can
save a single playing card as a list, you can save a deck of playing cards as a
list of 52 sublists (one for each card). But let’s not bother—there’s a much
cleaner way to do the same thing. You can use a special class of list, known as
a **data frame**.


## 4.5 Factors 

Factors are how R represents categorical data as levels. It can store both
character and integer types of data. These factors are created with the help of
factor() functions, by taking a vector as input. We will talk more about factors
on Day 4.



## 4.6 Data Frames 

Data frames are the two-dimensional version of a list. They are far and away the
most useful storage structure for data analysis, and they provide an ideal way
to store an entire deck of cards. You can think of a data frame as R’s
equivalent to the Excel spreadsheet because it stores data in a similar format.

Data frames group vectors together into a two-dimensional table. Each vector
becomes a column in the table. As a result, each column of a data frame can
contain a different type of data; but within a column, every cell must be the
same type of data.

Creating a data frame by hand takes a lot of typing, but you can do it (if you
like) with the data.frame function. Give data.frame any number of vectors, each
separated with a comma. Each vector should be set equal to a name that describes
the vector. data.frame will turn each vector into a column of the new data
frame:
```{r}
df <- data.frame(HappyFace = c("ace", "two", "six"),
                 Suit = c("clubs", "clubs", "clubs"),
                 Value = c(1, 2, 3))
df
# View(df)
```

You’ll need to make sure that each vector is the same length (or can be made so
with R’s recycling rules) as data frames cannot combine columns of different
lengths.

In the previous code, I named the arguments in data.frame face, suit, and value,
but you can name the arguments whatever you like. data.frame will use your
argument names to label the columns of the data frame.

If you look at the type of a data frame, you will see that it is a list. In
fact, each data frame is a list with class data.frame. You can see what types of
objects are grouped together by a list (or data frame) with the str function:
```{r}
typeof(df)
class(df)
str(df)
# ?str
```
You could create this data frame with data.frame, but look at the typing
involved! You need to write three vectors, each with 52 elements:
```{r}
deck <- data.frame(
  face = c("king", "queen", "jack", "ten", "nine", "eight", "seven", "six",
    "five", "four", "three", "two", "ace", "king", "queen", "jack", "ten",
    "nine", "eight", "seven", "six", "five", "four", "three", "two", "ace",
    "king", "queen", "jack", "ten", "nine", "eight", "seven", "six", "five",
    "four", "three", "two", "ace", "king", "queen", "jack", "ten", "nine",
    "eight", "seven", "six", "five", "four", "three", "two", "ace"),
  suit = c("spades", "spades", "spades", "spades", "spades", "spades",
    "spades", "spades", "spades", "spades", "spades", "spades", "spades",
    "clubs", "clubs", "clubs", "clubs", "clubs", "clubs", "clubs", "clubs",
    "clubs", "clubs", "clubs", "clubs", "clubs", "diamonds", "diamonds",
    "diamonds", "diamonds", "diamonds", "diamonds", "diamonds", "diamonds",
    "diamonds", "diamonds", "diamonds", "diamonds", "diamonds", "hearts",
    "hearts", "hearts", "hearts", "hearts", "hearts", "hearts", "hearts",
    "hearts", "hearts", "hearts", "hearts", "hearts"),
  value = c(13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8,
    7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 13, 12, 11,
    10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
)
# View(deck)
## You can run View(deck) to invoke the data viewer in R.
```

You should avoid typing large data sets in by hand whenever possible. Typing can
lead to typos and errors. It is always better to acquire large data sets as a
computer file. We will cover loading data from files and saving to files in
tomorrow's content.


## \textcolor{red}{In-class exercises 1.6:}

1. Create an empty dataframe named df.
2. Create a dataframe using the four given vectors. Name the dataframe df. 

```{r}
# 2.
name = c('Anastasia', 'Dima', 'Katherine', 'James', 'Emily', 'Michael',
         'Matthew', 'Laura', 'Kevin', 'Jonas')
score = c(12.5, 9, 16.5, 12, 9, 20, 14.5, 13.5, 8, 19)
attempts = c(1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1)
qualify = c('yes', 'no', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'yes')

df <- data.frame(cbind(name,score,attempts,qualify))
df <- data.frame(name,score,attempts,qualify)

View(df)
```
3. Get the structure of df. 

4. Open df in the data viewer in R.
