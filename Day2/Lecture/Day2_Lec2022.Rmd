# 1. Tips on Writing Code

By default, RStudio will save your current “workspace” when you quit.
While convenient, this can mean that you make one-off changes to your
data and forget to save that command in your script. Starting with a
fresh session every time you open RStudio means you’ll learn to keep
every step of your analysis in your script, and you’ll know that you can
get back to where you were by rerunning the script.

## 1.1 Code readability

There are two very good reasons to try to write your code in a clear,
understandable way:

-   Other people might need to use your code to replicate your studies.
-   You might need to use your code, a few weeks/months/years after
    you’ve written it.

It’s possible to write R code that “works” perfectly, and produces all
the results and output you want, but proves very difficult to make
changes to when you have to come back to it (because a reviewer asked
for one additional analysis, etc. which happens very often.)

### 1.1.1 Formatting Tips

You can improve the readability of your code a lot by following a few
simple rules:

-   Put spaces between and around variable names and operators (=+-\*/)
-   Break up long lines of code
-   Use meaningful variable names composed of 2 or 3 words (avoid
    abbreviations unless they’re very common and you use them very
    consistently)

These rules can mean the difference between this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
lm1=lm(y~grp+grpTime,mydf,subset=sext1== "m")
```

and this:

```{r eval=F}
male_difference = lm(DepressionScore ~ Group + GroupTimeInteraction,
                     data = interview_data,
                     subset = BaselineSex == "Male")
```

R will treat both pieces of code exactly the same, but for any humans
reading, the nicer layout and meaningful names make it much easier to
understand what’s happening, and spot any errors in syntax or intent.

### 1.1.2 Keep a Consistent Style

Try to follow a consistent style for naming things, e.g. using \*\*
snake_case **for all your variable names in your R code, and** TitleCase
\*\* for the columns in your data. Either style is probably better than
lowercase with no spacing allmashedtogether. It doesn’t particularly
matter what that style is, as long as you’re consistent.

### 1.1.3 Write LOTS of Comments

One of the best things you can do to make R code readable and
understandable is write comments. R ignores lines that start with \# so
you can write whatever you want and it won’t affect the way your code
runs.

Comments that explain why something was done are great:

```{r eval=F}
# Need to reverse code the score for question 3
data$DepressionQ3 = 4 - data$DepressionQ3
```

Comments that explain what is being done are also helpful. These
comments might appear redundant for people who already understand R
code, but can be super helpful for you to learn what is going on and for
grading purposes as well.

```{r eval=F}
# Calculate the mean of the anxiety scores
anxiety_mean = mean(data$AnxietyTotal)
```

You can also put comments that remind you to fix certain errors.

```{r eval=F}
###### FIX HERE: This fails to converge #######

```

### 1.1.4 Google's R Style Guide

In QPM I, we would like you to follow the R Programming Style Guide by
Google to make your R code easier to read, share, and verify. For more
details, please check out this link:
<http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109l/unrestricted/resources/google-style.html>

## 1.2 Organizing Your Files

Working directories are extremely useful for keeping your work
organized. When you have hundreds of R files along with images and data,
it is much easier to find things using directories instead of putting
all the files in one folder. A directory is basically a folder that you
have created to save all your work.

### 1.2.1 Get the working directory

Each time you open R, it links itself to a directory on your computer,
which R calls the working directory. This is where R will look for files
when you attempt to load them, and it is where R will save files when
you save them. The location of your working directory will vary on
different computers. You can find out which directory by running the
getwd () function, which stands for "get the working directory".

```{r}
getwd()
```

### 1.2.2 Change the working directory

You can place data files straight into the folder that is your working
directory, or you can move your working directory to where your data
files are. You can move your working directory to any folder on your
computer with the function setwd(). Just give setwd the file path to
your new working directory. This may be from the root directory
(starting with / on a Mac), it may include a double-dot (..) to move
locally up a folder from the current directory, and it may include a
path from the current directory. You can set the working directory to a
folder dedicated to whichever project you are currently working on. That
way you can keep all of my data, scripts, graphs, and reports in the
same place. For example:

```{r eval=F}
setwd("/Users/river/Documents/GitHub/RCamp2023/Day2/Lecture")
```

If the file path does not begin with your root directory, R will assume
that it begins at your current working directory.

### 1.2.3 List files in the working directory

You can see what files are in your working directory with list.files().
If you see the file that you would like to open in your working
directory, then you are ready to proceed. How you open files in your
working directory will depend on which type of file you would like to
open.

```{r}
list.files()
```

### 1.2.4 Create a new directory

To create a directory in R, use the dir.create(path) method. The
dir.create() method accepts a folder generated in the current working
directory or specifies a path. Another way is to go to Session > Set Working Directory. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This creates a new directory inside the current directory at path = /Users/river/Documents/GitHub/RCamp2023/Day2/Lecture
# dir.create("./pset2")
```

## \textcolor{red}{In-class exercises 2.1:}

1.  Get your current working directory.
2.  Create a new directory and name it \*\* R_Camp \*\* .
3.  Set your working directory to \*\* \~./R_Camp \*\* .

# 2. Loading and Saving Data

In Day 1's lecture, we covered how to build a dataframe by hand-typing
all the values in each row and column. In this section, we will explore
the built-in datasets provided by base R. More importantly, we will
cover how to load data from sources like csv files or excel sheets, and
how to save the new dataframe that you have made modifications to.

## 2.1 Built-in Datasets

R comes with many data sets preloaded in the datasets package, which
comes with base R. These data sets are not very interesting, but they
give you a chance to test code or make a point without having to load a
data set from outside R. You can see a list of R’s data sets as well as
a short description of each by running:

```{r}
help(package = "datasets")
```

To use a data set, just type its name. Each data set is already presaved
as an R object. For example:

```{r output.lines = 10}
iris
mtcars
```

You can use the summary() function to summarize the dataset. The
function tells you the minimum, maximum and quartiles for each column.
If there are NAs in your dataframe, it also tells you how many NAs there
are in each column.

```{r}
summary(iris)
```

However, when doing your own research, you will need to load your own
data into R from a wide variety of file formats. Before you can load any
data files into R, you will need to tell R where your working directory
is.

## 2.2 Loading Data from Sources

### 2.2.1 CSV Files

R provides several read functions for you to load data from files, which
are shortcuts for read.table with different default arguments. The most
commonly used one is read.csv. You will probably use this function
hundreds of times during our sequence of methods courses here at WashU.
As suggested by its name, the function read.csv allows you to load in
comma-separated-variable (CSV) files. For example:

```{r}
school_loc <- read.csv("school_loc.csv")
# remove(school_loc)
```

### 2.2.2 HTML Links

Many data files are made available on the Internet at their own web
address. If you are connected to the Internet, you can open these files
straight into R with read.csv (or other functions based on read.table).
You can pass a web address into the file name argument for any of R’s
data-reading functions. For example:

```{r eval = F}
school_loc <- read.csv("https://data-nces.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a15e8731a17a46aabc452ea607f172c0_0.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D")
# View(school_loc)
# https://www.data.gov/
```

Just make sure that the web address links directly to the file and not
to a web page that links to the file. Usually, when you visit a data
file’s web address, the file will begin to download or the raw data will
appear in your browser window.

### 2.2.3 R Files

R provides two file formats of its own for storing data, .RDS and
.RData. RDS files can store a single R object, and RData files can store
multiple R objects.

You can open a RDS file with readRDS. For example, if the royal flush
data was saved as poker.RDS, you could open it with:

```{r eval = F}
school_loc <- readRDS("stuff.RDS")
```

Opening RData files is even easier. Simply run the function load with
the file:

```{r eval=F}
# be careful not to assign overlapping data name
# a <- 'text'
load("stuff.RData")
```

There’s no need to assign the output to an object. The R objects in your
RData file will be loaded into your R session with their original names.
RData files can contain multiple R objects, so loading one may read in
multiple objects. load doesn’t tell you how many objects it is reading
in, nor what their names are, so it pays to know a little about the
RData file before you load it.

If worse comes to worst, you can keep an eye on the environment pane in
RStudio as you load an RData file. It displays all of the objects that
you have created or loaded during your R session. Another useful trick
is to put parentheses around your load command like so,
(load("file.RData")). This will cause R to print out the names of each
object it loads from the file.

Both readRDS and load take a file path as their first argument, just
like R’s other read and write functions. If your file is in your working
directory, the file path will be the file name.

## 2.4 Saving Data to Files

### 2.4.1 R Files

You can save an R object like a data frame as either an RData file or an
RDS file. RData files can store multiple R objects at once, but RDS
files are the better choice because they foster reproducible code.

To save data as an RData object, use the save function. To save data as
a RDS object, use the saveRDS function. In each case, the first argument
should be the name of the R object you wish to save. You should then
include a file argument that has the file name or file path you want to
save the data set to.

For example, if you have three R objects, a, b, and c, you could save
them all in the same RData file and then reload them in another R
session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
a <- 1
b <- 2
c <- 3
save(a, b, c, file = "stuff.RData")
load("stuff.RData")
```

However, if you forget the names of your objects or give your file to
someone else to use, it will be difficult to determine what was in the
file—even after you (or they) load it. The user interface for RDS files
is much more clear. You can save only one object per file, and whoever
loads it can decide what they want to call their new data. As a bonus,
you don’t have to worry about load overwriting any R objects that
happened to have the same name as the objects you are loading:

```{r eval = FALSE}
saveRDS(a, file = "stuff.RDS") # saving a to RDS file 
a <- readRDS("stuff.RDS")
```

Saving your data as an R file offers some advantages over saving your
data as a plain-text file. R automatically compresses the file and will
also save any R-related metadata associated with your object. This can
be handy if your data contains factors, dates and times, or class
attributes. You won’t have to reparse this information into R the way
you would if you converted everything to a text file.

On the other hand, R files cannot be read by many other programs, which
makes them inefficient for sharing. They may also create a problem for
long-term storage if you don’t think you’ll have a copy of R when you
reopen the files.

### 2.4.2 CSV Files

You can also use write.csv to save your data as a .csv file. The first
argument is the R object that contains your data set. The file argument
is the file name (including extension) that you wish to give the saved
data. By default, the function will save your data into your working
directory. However, you can supply a file path to the file argument. R
will oblige by saving the file at the end of the file path. If the file
path does not begin with your root directory, R will append it to the
end of the file path that leads to your working directory.

For example, you can save the school location data frame to a
subdirectory named data within your working directory with the command:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# write.csv(r_object, file = filepath, row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(school_loc, "data/school_loc.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Keep in mind that write.csv cannot create new directories on your
computer. Each folder in the file path must exist before you try to save
a file with it.

The row.names argument prevents R from saving the data frame’s row names
as a column in the plain-text file. You might have noticed that R
automatically names each row in a data frame with a number.

## \textcolor{red}{In-class exercises 2.2:}

1.  Load the world total fertility rate dataset from dataset.csv. Name
    the dataframe TFR.
2.  Create a new directory named data.
3.  Save the dataframe as "newdata.csv" into the new directory that you
    just created.

```{r}

```

# 3. R Notations

In Day 1's lecture, we covered how to create a vector, a list, and most
importantly a data frame. Now we need to know how to manipulate the
individual values inside your data frame. You can select values within
an R object with R’s notation system.

## 3.1 Selecting Values

R has a notation system that lets you extract values from R objects. To
extract a value or set of values from a data frame, write the data
frame’s name followed by a pair of hard brackets:

```{r eval=F}
school_loc[ , ]
# typeof(school_loc)
# class(school_loc)
```

Between the brackets will go two indices separated by a comma. The
indices tell R which values to return. R will use the first index to
subset the rows of the data frame and the second index to subset the
columns.

You have a choice when it comes to writing indices. There are six
different ways to write an index for R, and each does something slightly
different. They are all very simple and quite handy, so let’s take a
look at each of them. You can create indices with: \* Positive integers
\* Negative integers \* Zero \* Blank spaces \* Logical values \* Names

The simplest and most commonly used of these is positive integers.

### 3.1.1 Positive integers

R treats positive integers just like the ij notation used in linear
algebra: school_loc[i,j] will return the value of dataframe that is in
the ith row and the jth column. Notice that i and j only need to be
integers in the mathematical sense. They can be saved as numerics in R
(See Day 1's Lecture).

```{r}
head(school_loc)
tail(school_loc)
# View(school_loc)
school_loc[1,2]
```

Notice that the row and column indices for R starts at 1, instead of 0
in some other programming languages.

To extract more than one value, use a vector of positive integers. For
example, you can return the first three elements in the first row with:

```{r}
school_loc[1, c(1,2,3)]
```

R will return the values of school_loc that are in both the first row
and the first, second, and third columns. Note that R won’t actually
remove these values from the dataframe. R will give you a new set of
values which are copies of the original values. You can then save this
new set to an R object with R’s assignment operator:

```{r}
newdf <- school_loc[1, c(1,2,3)]
newdf = school_loc[1, c(1,2,3)]
newdf
```

If you repeat a number in your index, R will return the corresponding
value(s) more than once in your “subset.” This code will return the
first row of school_loc twice:

```{r}
school_loc[c(1,1), c(1,2,3)]
```

R’s notation system is not limited to data frames. You can use the same
syntax to select values in any R object, as long as you supply one index
for each dimension of the object. So, for example, you can subset a
vector (which has one dimension) with a single index:

```{r}
vec <- c(2,4,6,8,10)
vec[1:3]
1:3
```

If you select two or more columns from a data frame, R will return a new
data frame:

```{r}
school_loc[1:2,1:2]
```

However, if you select a single column, R will return a vector:

```{r}
school_loc[1:2, 1]
```

If you would prefer a data frame instead, you can add the optional
argument drop = FALSE between the brackets. This method also works for
selecting a single column from a matrix or an array.

```{r}
school_loc[1:2, 1, drop = FALSE]
# school_loc[1:2, 1, drop = T]
```

### 3.1.2 Negative integers

Negative integers do the exact opposite of positive integers when
indexing. R will return every element except the elements in a negative
index. For example, school_loc[-1, 1:3] will return everything but the
first row. school_loc[-(2:52), 1:3] will return the first row (and
exclude everything else):

```{r eval=FALSE}
school_loc[-1, 1:3]
school_loc[-(2:52), 1:3]
school_loc[c(-1,-3), 1, drop=F]
```

Negative integers are a more efficient way to subset than positive
integers if you want to include the majority of a data frame’s rows or
columns.

R will return an error if you try to pair a negative integer with a
positive integer in the same index:

```{r eval=FALSE}
school_loc[c(-1, 1), 1]
# Error in xj[i] : only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts
```

However, you can use both negative and positive integers to subset an
object if you use them in different indexes (e.g., if you use one in the
rows index and one in the columns index, like school_loc[-1, 1]).

```{r eval=F}
school_loc[-1, 1, drop=F]
```

### 3.1.3 Zero

What would happen if you used zero as an index? Zero is neither a
positive integer nor a negative integer, but R will still use it to do a
type of subsetting. R will return nothing from a dimension when you use
zero as an index. This creates an empty object:

```{r}
# data frame with 0 columns and 0 rows
x <- school_loc[0, 0, drop = F]
dim(x) # 0 0 

# creating same class, attributes, structure of objects
# class(school_loc)
# class(x)
# attributes(school_loc)
# attributes(x)

```

To be honest, indexing with zero is not very helpful and you will rarely
need it.

### 3.1.4 Blank spaces

You can use a blank space to tell R to extract every value in a
dimension. This lets you subset an object on one dimension but not the
others, which is useful for extracting entire rows or columns from a
data frame:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This extracts the first row 
school_loc[1,]
# This extracts the first column  
school_loc[,1]
```

### 3.1.5 Logical values

If you supply a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs as your index, R will match
each TRUE and FALSE to a row in your data frame (or a column depending
on where you place the index). R will then return each row that
corresponds to a TRUE.

It may help to imagine R reading through the data frame and asking,
"Should I return the \_i_th row of the data structure?" and then
consulting the \_i_th value of the index for its answer. For this system
to work, your vector must be as long as the dimension you are trying to
subset:

```{r}
dim(school_loc) # [1] 7012   26
# You can use the multiplication symbol here as a shortcut to the FALSEs. 
head(school_loc)

num_cols <- ncol(school_loc) # 26
school_loc[1, c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, rep(FALSE, num_cols - 3))]

```

This system may seem odd—who wants to type so many TRUEs and FALSEs? But
it will become very powerful in the next section on modifying values.

It is important to note here that TRUE is equivalent to 1 and FALSE is
equivalent to 0. You can use the function as.integer() to convert the
logicals into their corresponding numeric values.

```{r}
as.integer(TRUE)
as.integer(FALSE)

as.logical(1)
as.logical(100)
as.logical(-1)
as.logical(0) # notice here only 0 is equivalent to FALSE, all non-zero integers are equivalent to 1
```

### 3.1.6 Names

Finally, you can ask for the elements you want by name—if your object
has names. This is a common way to extract the columns of a data frame,
since columns almost always have names:

```{r}
# If you do not remember the exact names of each column, 
# you can first use the function colnames() to list all the column names. 
colnames(school_loc)

school_loc[1:10, c("X", "Y", "NAME", "SCHOOLYEAR")]
```

## \textcolor{red}{In-class exercises 2.3:}

Now that you know the basics of R’s notation system, let’s put it to
use.

1.  Extract all values from the first ten rows from school_loc
2.  Extract the 100th row from school_loc
3.  Extract the 200th to 300th rows from school_loc, but only from the
    following columns: NAME, STREET, CITY, STATE, ZIP.

```{r}
school_loc[1:10,]
school_loc[c(1:10),]
```

## 3.2 Dollar Signs and Double Brackets

Two types of object in R obey an optional second system of notation. You
can extract values from data frames and lists with the \$ syntax. You
will encounter the \$ syntax again and again as an R programmer, so
let’s examine how it works.

To select a column from a data frame, write the data frame’s name and
the column name separated by a \$. Notice that no quotes should go
around the column name:

```{r}
# For illustration purpose, I will just use a subset of the original school location dataset. 
sub_school_loc <- school_loc[1:10,]
sub_school_loc$NAME
```

R will return all of the values in the column as a vector. This \$
notation is incredibly useful because you will often store the variables
of your data sets as columns in a data frame. From time to time, you’ll
want to run a function like mean or median on the values in a variable.
In R, these functions expect a vector of values as input:

```{r}
mean(school_loc$X)
median(school_loc$Y)
max(school_loc$Y)
```

You can use the same \$ notation with the elements of a list, if they
have names. This notation has an advantage with lists, too. If you
subset a list in the usual way, R will return a new list that has the
elements you requested. This is true even if you only request a single
element. For example:

```{r}
l <- list(numbers = c(1, 2), logical = TRUE, strings = c("a", "b", "c"))
l

# And then subset it:
typeof(l[1])
class(l[1])
l$numbers
```

The result is a smaller list with one element. That element is the
vector c(1, 2). This can be annoying because many R functions do not
work with lists. For example, sum(l[1]) will return an error. It would
be horrible if once you stored a vector in a list, you could only ever
get it back as a list:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sum(l[1])
# Error in sum(l[1]) : invalid 'type' (list) of argument
```

When you use the \$ notation, R will return the selected values as they
are, with no list structure around them:

```{r}
l$numbers
l[1]
l$strings
```

You can then immediately feed the results to a function:

```{r}
sum(l$numbers)
```

If the elements in your list do not have names (or you do not wish to
use the names), you can use two brackets, instead of one, to subset the
list. This notation will do the same thing as the \$ notation:

```{r}
sum(l[[1]])
l[1]
```

In other words, if you subset a list with single-bracket notation, R
will return a smaller list. If you subset a list with double-bracket
notation, R will return just the values that were inside an element of
the list. You can combine this feature with any of R’s indexing methods:

```{r}
l["numbers"]
typeof(l["numbers"])

l[["numbers"]]
typeof(l[["numbers"]])
sum(l[["numbers"]])
```

This difference is subtle but important. In the R community, there is a
popular, and helpful, way to think about it. Imagine that each list is a
train and each element is a train car. When you use single brackets, R
selects individual train cars and returns them as a new train. Each car
keeps its contents, but those contents are still inside a train car
(i.e., a list). When you use double brackets, R actually unloads the car
and gives you back the contents.

# 4. Modifying Values

In this section, you will learn how to change the actual values that are
stored inside your data frame. This is all adding up to something
special: complete control of your data. You can now store your data in
your computer, retrieve individual values at will, and use your computer
to perform correct calculations with those values.

## 4.1 Changing Values in Place

You can use R’s notation system to modify values within an R object.
First, describe the value (or values) you wish to modify. Then use the
assignment operator \<- to overwrite those values. R will update the
selected values in the original object. Let’s put this into action with
a real example:

```{r}
vec <- c(1:10)
vec
vec <- c(10:20)
vec
```

Here’s how you can select the first value of vec:

```{r}
vec[1]
```

And here is how you can modify it:

```{r}
vec[1] <- 999
vec
vec[-1] <- 0
vec
```

You can replace multiple values at once as long as the number of new
values equals the number of selected values:

```{r}
vec[c(1, 3, 5)] <- c(1000, 3000, 5000)
vec

vec[4:6] <- vec[4:6] + 1
vec

```

You can also create values that do not yet exist in your object. R will
expand the object to accommodate the new values:

```{r}
vec <- c(1:10)
length(vec)
vec[12] <- 0
vec
```

Notice the NA in the vector. Our original vector has 10 elements, but
here we added a new value at index 12 without specifying the value for
the 11th element. R will automatically fill in the unspecified elements
with NA. When writing your own code, try to avoid doing this. We usually
try to minimize the amount of NAs in our dataframe.

Now you can add new variables to your data set:

```{r}
school_loc$indices <- 1:7012
View(school_loc)
```

You can also remove columns from a data frame (and elements from a list)
by assigning them the symbol NULL:

```{r}
school_loc$newcol <- NULL
# View(school_loc)
colnames(school_loc)
```

You can single out just the values by subsetting the columns dimension.
You can also assign a new set of values to these old values. The set of
new values will have to be the same size as the set of values that you
are replacing.

```{r}
# To illustrate subsetting values, we add the new variable back. 
school_loc$newcol <- 1:7012

school_loc$newcol[c(1,3,5,7,9)] <- c(111, 333, 555, 777, 999)

# If you would like to set them to the same value, simply do: 
school_loc$newcol[c(2,4,6,8,10)] <- 1000
school_loc[1:10, "newcol"]
# View(school_loc)

```

Notice that the values change in place. You do not end up with a new
copy of the school_loc dataframe. The new values will appear inside the
school_loc dataframe.

The same technique will work whether you store your data in a vector,
matrix, list, or data frame. Just describe the values that you want to
change with R’s notation system, then assign over those values with R’s
assignment operator.

## 4.2 Logical Subsetting

Do you remember R’s logical index system, logicals? To recap, you can
select values with a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs. The vector must be the
same length as the dimension that you wish to subset. R will return
every element that matches a TRUE:

```{r}
vec2 <- c(1,0,2,0,3,4,5,0,9) 
vec2
vec2[c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

At first glance, this system might seem impractical. Who wants to type
out long vectors of TRUEs and FALSEs? No one. But you don’t have to. You
can let a logical test create a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs for you.

### 4.2.1 Logical Tests

A logical test is a comparison like “is one less than two?”, 1 \< 2, or
“is three greater than four?”, 3 \> 4. R provides seven logical
operators that you can use to make comparisons.

![R’s Logical Operators](/Users/ysui/Desktop/R_Camp/Day2/logicals.png)

Each operator returns a TRUE or a FALSE. If you use an operator to
compare vectors, R will do element-wise comparisons—just like it does
with the arithmetic operators:

```{r}
1 < 2
1 > c(0, 1, 2)

c(1, 2, 3) == c(3, 2, 1)

```

%in% is the only operator that does not do normal element-wise
execution. %in% tests whether the value(s) on the left side are in the
vector on the right side. If you provide a vector on the left side, %in%
will not pair up the values on the left with the values on the right and
then do element-wise tests. Instead, %in% will independently test
whether each value on the left is somewhere in the vector on the right:

```{r}
1 %in% c(3, 4, 5)

c(1, 2) %in% c(3, 4, 5)

c(1, 2, 3) %in% c(3, 4, 5)

c(1, 2, 3, 4) %in% c(3, 4, 5)

```

Notice that you test for equality with a double equals sign, ==, and not
a single equals sign, =, which is another way to write the assignment
operator \<-. It is easy to forget and use a = b to test if a equals b.
Unfortunately, you’ll be in for a nasty surprise. R won’t return a TRUE
or FALSE, because it won’t have to: a will equal b, because you just ran
the equivalent of a \<- b where you manually set the value of a to be b.

You can compare any two R objects with a logical operator; however,
logical operators make the most sense if you compare two objects of the
same data type. If you compare objects of different data types, R will
use its coercion rules to coerce the objects to the same type before it
makes the comparison and the result might be hard to interpret.

We again use the school location dataset as our example.

```{r eval=FALSE}
colnames(school_loc)
# First extract the column "X"
school_loc$X
# Use the < operator to check whether each value is less than -100
school_loc$X < -100
# Use the sum() function to check how many TRUEs there are 
# TRUE = 1 / FALSE = 0
sum(school_loc$X < -100)

# What does this do? 
school_loc$Y[school_loc$X < -100]

# What does this do?
school_loc$Y[school_loc$X < -100] <- 0
```

To summarize, you can use a logical test to select values within an
object.

Logical subsetting is a powerful technique because it lets you quickly
identify, extract, and modify individual values in your data set. When
you work with logical subsetting, you do not need to know where in your
data set a value exists. You only need to know how to describe the value
with a logical test.

Logical subsetting is one of the things R does best. In fact, logical
subsetting is a key component of vectorized programming, a coding style
that lets you write fast and efficient R code.

## \textcolor{red}{In-class exercises 2.4:}

Let's practice with the dataset TFR.

1.  Find the dimension of TFR. How many observations and variables?
2.  Add a new column called index to TFR, where the values are the
    indices for the rows.
3.  Select the first row of TFR.
4.  Select the first column of TFR.
5.  Get the last row of TFR.
6.  How many values in the column TFR are greater than 8?
7.  How many values in the column ChildBearing are over 25?
8.  What does this code do?

```{r eval = FALSE}
TFR$ChildBearing[TFR$ChildBearing > 25]
```

9.  Set all values in the column ChildBearing that are less than 25 to
    0.  

```{r}
TFR <- read.csv("dataset.csv")
sum(TFR$TFR > 8)
nrow(TFR[TFR$TFR > 8,])
typeof(TFR[TFR$TFR > 8,])
TFR[TFR$TFR >8]
typeof(TFR$TFR > 8)
nrow(TFR[TFR$TFR > 8,])
```

### 4.2.2 Boolean Operators

Boolean operators are things like and (&) and or (\|). They collapse the
results of multiple logical tests into a single TRUE or FALSE. R has six
boolean operators.

![Boolean Operators](/Users/ysui/Desktop/R_Camp/Day2/booleans.png)

To use a Boolean operator, place it between two complete logical tests.
R will execute each logical test and then use the Boolean operator to
combine the results into a single TRUE or FALSE. If you do not supply a
complete test to each side of the operator, R will return an error.

When used with vectors, Boolean operators will follow the same
element-wise execution as arithmetic and logical operators:

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c(1, 2, 3)
c <- c(1, 2, 4)
a == b
b == c
a == b & b == c
# (TRUE TRUE TRUE) & (TRUE  TRUE FALSE)
```

## \textcolor{red}{In-class exercises 2.4:}

If you think you have the hang of logical tests, try converting these
sentences into tests written with R code. To help you out, I’ve defined
some R objects after the sentences that you can use to test your
answers:

1.  Is w positive?
2.  Is x greater than 10 and less than 20?
3.  Is object y the word February?
4.  Is every value in z a day of the week?
5.  What does this expression evaluate to and why?

```{r}
w <- c(-1, 0, 1)
x <- c(5, 15)
y <- "February"
z <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Friday")
(TRUE + TRUE) * FALSE
```

6.  Use logical operators to output only those rows of data in TFR where
    column Year is between 1950 and 1955 inclusively.

7.  Use logical operators to output only those rows of data where column
    TFR is equal to 7.45 and column Year is greater than 1960.

8.  Use logical operators to output only the even rows of the dataframe.

9.  Use logical operators and change every 4th element in column
    LifeExpB to 0.

```{r}
data <- TFR
# 6
data[data$Year >= 1950 & data$Year <= 1955,]

# 7
data[data$TFR == 7.45 & data$Year > 1960,]

# 8
data[c(F,T),]

# 9
data$LifeExpB[c(F,F,F,T)] <- 0

# %% 

```

## 4.3 Missing Information (NA)

Missing information problems happen frequently in data science. Usually,
they are more straightforward: you don’t know a value because the
measurement was lost, corrupted, or never taken to begin with. R has a
way to help you manage these missing values.

The NA character is a special symbol in R. It stands for “not available”
and can be used as a placeholder for missing information. R will treat
NA exactly as you should want missing information treated. For example,
what result would you expect if you add 1 to a piece of missing
information?

```{r}
1 + NA
```

R will return a second piece of missing information. It would not be
correct to say that 1 + NA = 1 because there is a good chance that the
missing quantity is not zero. You do not have enough information to
determine the result.

What if you tested whether a piece of missing information is equal to 1?

```{r}
NA == 3.14
```

Again, your answer would be something like “I do not know if this is
equal to one,” that is, NA. Generally, NAs will propagate whenever you
use them in an R operation or function. This can save you from making
errors based on missing data.

### 4.3.1 na.rm

Missing values can help you work around holes in your data sets, but
they can also create some frustrating problems. Suppose, for example,
that you’ve collected 1,000 observations and wish to take their average
with R’s mean function. If even one of the values is NA, your result
will be NA:

```{r}
c(NA, 1:50)
mean(c(NA, 1:50))
```

Understandably, you may prefer a different behavior. Most R functions
come with the optional argument, na.rm, which stands for NA remove. R
will ignore NAs when it evaluates a function if you add the argument
na.rm = TRUE:

```{r}
mean(c(NA, 1:50), na.rm = TRUE)
mean(c(1:50)) # which returns the same value as above
```

### 4.3.2 is.na

On occasion, you may want to identify the NAs in your data set with a
logical test, but that too creates a problem. How would you go about it?
If something is a missing value, any logical test that uses it will
return a missing value, even this test:

```{r}
NA == NA
```

Which means that tests like this won’t help you find missing values:

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, NA) == NA
```

But don’t worry too hard; R supplies a special function that can test
whether a value is an NA. The function is sensibly named is.na:

```{r}
is.na(NA)
vec3 <- c(1, 2, 3, NA)
is.na(vec3)
```

```{r}
# What does this do?
school_loc$ZIP[school_loc$X < -100] <- NA
View(school_loc)
```

### 4.3.2 na.omit

You can also remove all observations containing NA's in any column by
using the na.omit() function. For example,

```{r eval=FALSE}
summary(school_loc)
new_df <- na.omit(school_loc)
summary(new_df)
```

## \textcolor{red}{In-class exercises 2.5:}

1.  What is the length of X?

```{r}
X <- c (123,0,NA,8,NA,200)
na.omit(X)
X
```

2.  Can you find all occurrences of NA in X? How can you find the total
    number of NAs in X?

3.  Can you remove all occurrences of NA in X?

4.  Can you replace all occurrences of NA with 88?

5.  We will use the TFR dataset again. Create a new dataframe TFR2 where
    you drop all NA's.

6.  Find the dimension of TFR2. How many observations are left?

7.  Create a new dataframe TFR3 where you remove all rows with NA values
    in the GDPpc column.

```{r}
TFR3 <- TFR[!is.na(TFR$GDPpc), ]
View(TFR3)
```
